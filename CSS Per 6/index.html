    <h1> Personal Career Goals</h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <p>My career goals are to become wealthy and find a job where I make good money and where I find
        happiness. This is my goal because the reason I want to work is so I can start a family and live a happy
        life. While doing all of this, I would like to make a lot of money so I can fund charities and take care of
        people and help communites in need.
    </p>
    <h1> Strengths and Personal Qualities</h1>
    <h1></h1>
    <p> Some strengths I have highlighted include my ability to complete tasks at a quick rate. And it is very effective
        if you also need me to multi-task because I can also do that. Eventhough I am quick with my responses I am also
        very accurate. I am mentally strong so I can handle lots of work and have no problem with doing that.</p>
            <h1>Important Achivements</h1>
            <h1></h1>
            <p> Some of my many achivments include my 1 year python certificate gifted to me from YoungWonks. Another
                one is
                pretty recently when I created a game that included soccer starts CR7 and Lionel Messi fighting each
                other. This
                was a original piece and never done before. I would list all of them but it would too long for this
                portfolio.
                
            </p>

            <h1> My abilities and work skills</h1>
            <h1></h1>
            <p> I have lots of experience in working in groups but I much prefer to be working alone because it helps me
                concernatrate and I can finish my work much faster. But if I am needed to help a group or some young
                interns
                with their code, I can do that and I am a good teacher as I am calm and deal well under pressure and
                time
                constraints. I wouldn't consider myself as a leader but I can do any position and make my boss proud.
            </p>
            <h1> Conclusion</h1>
            <h1></h1>
            <p> In conclusion I have lots of goals that I am determined to complete and I have my life plan set up. I
                just know
                have to put in the hours and effort to make these goals come to reality. I have many strengths that will
                help
                the group and the company and if you need work to be done quick and done effective, I am your guy. My
                specility
                is multi-tasking. And I have many achivements to back me up like my coding certificate from YoungWonks.
                And
                lastly my work experience and skills make me a well rounded canditate to apply for a company and I will
                take
